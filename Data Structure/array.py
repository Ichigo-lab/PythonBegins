from array import array

numbers = array("i", [1, 2, 3])
print(numbers)
# "i" is typecode for integer
# Unlike list, all the object in array should be of same type
# we use same method as of list like remove ,append, pop, insert, access by index
# arrays are rarely used in python
# only use array if list fails
